# Food-_beverage_Market_Analysis

## Problem Statement:

CodeX is a German beverage company aiming to establish its presence in the Indian market. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities in India. They require insights based on the given data, so we need to perform proper data cleaning and infer insights from the data.

### Data Insights:

1. Individuals between the ages of 19 and 30 show more interest in the energy drink, making them our target customers.

2. People who regularly go to the gym are more interested in the energy drink.

3. Cola-Coka currently holds the position of the market leader.

4. Consumers prefer organic drinks over artificial ones.

5. Consumers expect our drink to be priced below 100 rupees.

6. While our brand is well-known in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai, it is weaker in tier-2 cities like Lucknow, Jaipur, Kolkata. Therefore, we should focus on these cities.

7. As our product is more suitable for gym-goers, they prefer our drink to contain more caffeine.

8. Online ads have a positive impact on our product, so focusing on online branding would be more beneficial.

9. Our drink should contain less sugar, as per the preference of most people.
